This Property was brought to AcreTrader through our local agricultural network as a sale-leaseback. A sale-leaseback is a term used to describe a real estate transaction wherein real estate is sold and the buyer then leases the real estate back to the seller. Sale-leasebacks are commonly used in AcreTrader’s approach to asset sourcing, because it allows operators to access capital tied up in land ownership while maintaining the acreage under management.",

This serves to extend the growing for many crops and increase the number of crops suitable for the area.
