# Engineering the Terra System for Secure, Scalable, and Resilient Interactions
For the Terra system, securely pulling data from various API endpoints and services in the front-end (built using React) requires a well-designed strategy to ensure both security and performance. Here’s the best strategy broken down into key aspects:

## 1. **Backend as a Proxy Layer**
   - **Avoid Direct API Calls from the Front-End**: Directly calling third-party APIs from the front-end exposes sensitive details like API keys or tokens. Instead, the front-end should interact with a secure backend server, which acts as a **proxy layer**. The backend handles the communication with external APIs and services and returns the sanitized data to the front-end.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Ensures API keys and credentials are stored securely on the server-side.
     - Centralizes API logic, allowing easier maintenance, updates, and security enhancements.
     - Adds flexibility to transform, filter, or cache data before sending it to the front-end.

## 2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Use OAuth or JWT Tokens**: For user-specific interactions, the backend should authenticate users using **OAuth** or **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. 
     - **OAuth**: Ideal for accessing third-party APIs (e.g., WordPress REST API). The backend can request access tokens on behalf of the user and handle refreshing tokens securely.
     - **JWT**: The backend generates a JWT token for user authentication. React can then send this token with each request to authenticate users and authorize actions on secured endpoints.
   - **Session Management**: Use short-lived tokens (with refresh tokens) to minimize security risks in case of token leaks.

## 3. **API Gateway Integration**
   - **Centralized API Gateway**: Use an **API Gateway** to route all API calls from the backend. This gateway can securely manage access to various services, APIs, and third-party endpoints. It can also handle:
     - Rate limiting, caching, and load balancing.
     - Authentication and token validation.
     - Logging and monitoring of API requests.
   - **Benefits**: Provides an extra layer of security and scalability.

## 4. **Securing Data Transport**
   - **Enforce HTTPS**: Ensure all communications between the React app, backend server, and API services use **HTTPS**. This encrypts the data in transit and prevents interception by malicious actors.
   - **CORS Policies**: Implement strict **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** policies on the backend to only allow authorized domains to interact with the API.
     - For example, only the Terra front-end domain should be allowed to make API calls.

## 5. **API Keys and Secrets Management**
   - **Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**: Store API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information in **environment variables** on the backend, never in the front-end code or version control systems.
   - **API Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and tokens to reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

## 6. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
   - **Backend Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on the backend to prevent abuse and overloading of APIs, especially when dealing with third-party services.
   - **API Gateway Rate Limiting**: If using an API gateway, set up global rate limiting to handle bursts of requests while protecting the system.

## 7. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - **Graceful Error Handling in the Backend**: When interacting with external APIs, the backend should gracefully handle errors like rate limiting (HTTP 429), timeouts, or failed authentication, and respond appropriately to the front-end.
   - **Retry Mechanism**: Implement retry logic and exponential backoff for failed API calls in case of transient issues, ensuring the system remains resilient to temporary disruptions.

## 8. **Caching**
   - **Backend Caching**: Use caching mechanisms (e.g., **Redis**, **API Gateway caching**) on the backend to store frequently requested data from third-party APIs. This reduces load and improves performance.
   - **Browser Caching**: Implement HTTP caching headers on the front-end for static data, reducing unnecessary network requests.

## 9. **Security Best Practices for Front-End (React)**
   - **Secure JWT Storage**: Store JWT tokens in **HTTP-only cookies** instead of `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to prevent XSS attacks.
   - **Input Validation**: Always sanitize and validate input before sending it to the backend to prevent injection attacks.
   - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict CSP to mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the resources that the front-end can load.

## 10. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - **Comprehensive Logging**: Implement logging on the backend to track API requests, errors, and performance issues. Logging should include:
     - API usage per user.
     - Failed authentication attempts.
     - Third-party API errors.
   - **Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring tools (e.g., **Datadog**, **New Relic**) to track performance, errors, and security threats in real time, ensuring proactive incident response.

## Example Flow for Secure API Calls in Terra

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - User logs in via the Terra front-end (React), which sends credentials to the backend.
   - Backend authenticates the user, generates a JWT token, and stores it in an HTTP-only cookie.

2. **Fetching Content from Third-Party APIs**: 
   - The front-end sends a request to the Terra backend to fetch content.
   - The backend processes this request, communicates securely with external APIs (e.g., WordPress API, schema registry, etc.), and applies any necessary transformations.
   - The backend returns the filtered, sanitized content to the front-end for display.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs while fetching from external APIs (e.g., rate limiting), the backend handles the retry logic or returns a meaningful error message to the front-end for user-friendly error handling.

4. **Data Security**:
   - All communication is done over HTTPS, and sensitive data such as tokens or API keys never reach the front-end.
   - The API gateway ensures that only authorized requests from the Terra front-end are allowed through.

## Key Takeaways
- **Backend as a Proxy**: Centralizes all API interactions, ensuring security and scalability.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Protects resources and allows secure API communication.
- **API Gateway**: Adds security, scalability, and management features to handle all API calls.
- **Secure Storage of Credentials**: API keys, tokens, and sensitive data are never exposed in the front-end.
- **Rate Limiting, Caching, and Monitoring**: Ensures performance and resilience while preventing abuse.

By employing this strategy, Terra’s React front-end can securely and efficiently interact with various API services without compromising sensitive information or performance.
