# Agsiri Manifesto

## Igniting the Revolution in Regenerative Agriculture

At Agsiri, we are more than a company—we are a movement, a revolution aimed at transforming agriculture from the ground up. We believe in the power of change, the urgency of action, and the beauty of the natural world. Our mission is to redefine agriculture, turning it into a force for equity, sustainability, and prosperity. This manifesto captures the spirit, principles, and vision that guide us on this journey.

# **Principle 1: An Irresistible Revolution**
The revolution must be irresistible. It should be a force so compelling that it moves people not just to act, but to love the change they are part of. It must inspire joy, liberation, and beauty. By asking the big questions and seeking answers that invite all to participate, we believe in making regenerative agriculture a lifestyle and a movement that no one can resist. At Agsiri, we tell authentic stories of success, resilience, and the future we wish to build—stories that light the way to a new kind of agriculture.

We don't just grow crops; we grow a vision for a better world. Every farm, every piece of land, every harvest becomes part of a narrative that connects people back to the Earth and their communities. This revolution is a celebration of life, and through our stories and practices, we make the path to regenerative agriculture fun, inspiring, and liberating.

# **Principle 2: Seeking Equity for All**
Regenerative agriculture must be inclusive, embracing the wisdom and voices of all people, especially those historically marginalized. Too often, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities have been left out of the ecological farming conversation, despite their rich traditions, practices, and worldviews that have long supported a harmonious relationship with the land.

At Agsiri, we understand that the journey to heal our relationship with the land is inseparable from healing our relationship with people. We are committed to creating a revolution that is equitable, where diverse perspectives and hands are celebrated as essential to the story of regenerative farming. To fail in including these voices is to miss the essence of what it means to regenerate. We stand for social and ecological justice, ensuring that our work uplifts and empowers all stewards of the land.

# **Principle 3: Creating and Sharing Wealth**
True wealth is not just financial—it is the health of our land, our communities, and our souls. At Agsiri, we believe in creating a financial economy that mirrors the beautiful, resilient, and regenerative patterns of nature. Money should be more than a means to an end; it should be a tool that deepens relationships, encourages stewardship, and invests in systems that sustain life. 

We build financial opportunities for farmers and communities that honor and enhance natural ecosystems. By reinvesting in nature, we create circular wealth—value that flows back into the soil, water, and people who sustain our food systems. This is wealth that can be shared, grown, and regenerated. Our economy is one where success is not just about profit, but about nourishing all that sustains us, allowing wealth to flow where it can do the most good.

# **Principle 4: Reconnecting People to Place**
In our modern world, the connection between people and the Earth has frayed. At Agsiri, we seek to restore this bond, rekindling humanity’s relationship with the natural world and the communities that depend on it. We believe that to fall in love with the land is to begin a new, more compassionate relationship with the Earth.

We aim to create experiences that connect people to their surroundings—to the soil, the water, the trees, and the air they breathe. When people rediscover the beauty of their place, they become caretakers of that place. Through our investment strategies, community programs, and storytelling, we encourage stewardship of the land and the love of all living beings. By re-establishing these deep connections, we not only heal our environment but also heal ourselves.

# **Principle 5: Small Actions, Big Change**
Changing an entire system may seem overwhelming, but history has shown that a few dedicated individuals can create waves of transformation. At Agsiri, we work with stewards at the forefront—the innovators, the early adopters, the risk-takers, and the leaders. These are the people who take bold steps, who see the potential in new practices, and who pave the way for their neighbors and communities.

By focusing on these changemakers, we catalyze regional alternatives to conventional, commodity agriculture, unlocking new ways to farm that are scalable and sustainable. We empower those who are willing to stand at the edge, helping them to lead and inspire others. It only takes a few to spark a revolution that transforms the whole.

# **Principle 6: Place-Based Regeneration**
Our work is born of place. While Agsiri’s headquarters is based in Vineland, New Jersey, our mission reaches across the country, grounded in the unique conditions and needs of each community we serve. Regenerative agriculture cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach; it must be deeply connected to the landscape, culture, and history of each region.

We work closely with local farmers, land stewards, and community leaders to ensure our efforts are rooted in the realities of each place. This place-based approach ensures that regeneration is authentic and lasting, meeting the specific needs of the land and its people. We believe that every community has its own wisdom and resources to contribute to this revolution, and by honoring these differences, we build a network of regenerative practices that span the nation.

# **Our Vision for the Future**
We envision a world where agriculture is no longer extractive, but regenerative—where every seed planted, every crop harvested, and every investment made builds towards a healthier planet. We see farmers as stewards, investors as partners, and communities as the heartbeat of a new agricultural system that respects and renews the Earth.

In this world, wealth is shared equitably, and the stories we tell inspire action. Land is valued not just for what it produces, but for its ability to sustain life and foster relationships. Every farm becomes a place of beauty, resilience, and growth, rooted in the principles of regeneration.
